# Tic-Tac-Toe-Project
A.L.L Tic-Tac-Toe Game in python

This game was created for the activity lead learning as Coventry University and we had a group of four people who were assigned to create
the game. The game is written in Python using the Pygame module.

How do i run the game?
Simply running the Main.py file will allow you to play the game. You should be able to find your way around from here.

How do i play against an AI?
After running the Main.py file go into the settings menu from the main menu and click the box until it says that you will play against AI.
There will be another option which will appear to change the AI difficulity however currently there is only an easy Ai.

How do i play the networked version of the game?
First of all you will need to run the Server.py file which will start the server so it is ready for two players to connect. The server 
will not do anything untill two people have connected. 
Next you will need to run the Main.py file twice to create two instances of the game.
You will then need to go into the settings menu and choose player vs player(online) this will connect you to the server.
When two people have connected to the server player 1 will be able to take thier turn.
